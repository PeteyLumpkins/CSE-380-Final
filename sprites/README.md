# Sprites 

I'd like to try and start making some sprites for our game. It doesn't have to be anything crazy, but later in the Spring we probably don't want to be messing around trying to make sprites. Most of our time is probably going to be spent working with the code and the functionality of the game. If we can get some of the
artsy parts out of the way now, that would be good.
