# Design Notes / Thoughts


## Player Controller

* I think we could adapt the CarController from homework3 to be the controllr for our player. It has the movement keys and attack inputs already connected. 
* We might have to add some things to check for wall collisions between the player and our tilemap. We could probably get this from hw4

## The maps

* We could probably steal some of the code used to load in the world map from homework4 to load in our world.
